If you are talking about actual competitive 
programming - you’d better look at sites like 
Codeforces, CS Academy or AtCoder. I can’t pick 
“best one”, because there are different aspects
to consider: active community, high-quality
problems, number of contests, amount of resources
available for learning etc. For different aspects
I have different sites ranked as “the best”,
and I don’t know how to get some overall
weighted all-around ranking here.
