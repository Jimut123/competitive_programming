If you are talking about actual competitive programming - you’d better look at sites like Codeforces, CS Academy or AtCoder. I can’t pick “best one”, because there are different aspects to consider: active community, high-quality problems, number of contests, amount of resources available for learning etc. For different aspects I have different sites ranked as “the best”, and I don’t know how to get some overall weighted all-around ranking here.
