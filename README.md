### Submitting a Pull Request based on an existing proposal

When submitting a pull request that uses code from an unmerged pull request, please be aware of the following:
  * Changes proposed in the older pull request is still the original author's property. Moving forward from where they left it
    means that you're a `co-author`.
  * GitHub allows attributing
    [credit to multiple authors](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-commit-with-multiple-authors)
    However, pull requests in this project are automatically squashed and then merged onto the base branch. So, only authors and
    co-authors of the opening commit gets credit once the pull request gets merged.
  * If the original pull request contained multiple commits, you may squash them into a single commit but ensure that you list
    any additional authors (and yourselves) as co-authors of that commit.
  * Use appropriate [keywords](https://help.github.com/en/articles/closing-issues-using-keywords) in your pull request post to
    link to the existing pull request or issue-ticket so that they're automatically closed when your pull request gets merged.
